This plugin adds little shooting stars to the night sky. Only works in overworld typed worlds. Will automatically disable when the TPS is lower than 16. More information coming soon!

### Note: This plugin requires [Paper](https://papermc.io/) to work! Switch from Spigot to Paper without any deficits!
